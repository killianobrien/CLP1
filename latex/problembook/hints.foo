For (c), set $y(x)=\cosh^{-1}(x)$, so $\cosh(y(x))=x$. The differentiate using the chain rule. To get your final answer in terms of $x$ (instead of $y$), use the identity $\cosh^2(y)-\sinh^2(y)=1$.

What is the derivative of tangent?

What is an antiderivative of $\dfrac{1}{x}$?

$\dfrac{7}{\sqrt{3-3x^2}}=\dfrac{7}{\sqrt{3}}\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-x^2}}\right)$

How is this similar to the derivative of the arctangent function?

First, find the antiderivative of $f'(x)$. Your answer will have an unknown $+C$ in it. Figure out which value of $C$ gives $f(1)=10$.

Remember that one antiderivative of $\cos x$ is  $\sin x$ (not ~~$-\sin x$).
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.15]{H-15:} 
An antiderivative of $\dfrac{1}{x}$ is $\log(x)+C$, but this is not the most general antiderivative.

What is the derivative of the arcsine function?
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.17]{H-17:} 
If $P(t)$ is the population at time $t$, then the information given in the problem is
$P'(t)=100e^{2t}$.
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.18]{H-18:} 
You can't know exactly--there will be a constant involved.
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.19]{H-19:} 
If $P(t)$ is the amount of power in kW-hours the house has used since time $t=0$, where $t$ is measured in hours, then the information given is that $P'(t)=0.5\sin\left(\dfrac{\pi}{24}t\right)+0.25$ kW.

The derivatives should match. Remember $\sin^{-1}$ is another way of writing arcsine.
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.21]{H-21:} 
Think about the product rule.

Think about the quotient rule for derivatives.

Notice that the derivative of $x^3$  is $3x^2$.
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.24]{H-24:} 
Think about the chain rule for derivatives. You might need to multiply your first guess by a constant.

Simplify.
\flushleft \hyperref [q:4.1.0.26]{H-26:} 
This problem is similar to Question~\ref{s4.1arcsin1}, but you'll have to do some harder factoring. Try getting $f(x)$ into the form $a\left(\dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-(bx)^2}}\right)$ for some constants $a$ and $b$.

Following Example~\ref*{eg vol cone}, %4.1.7
let $V(H)$ be the volume of the solid formed by rotating the segment of the parabola from $x=-H$ to $x=H$.
            The plan is to evaluate\\
              $V'(H) = \ds\lim\limits_{h\rightarrow H}\frac{V(H)-V(h)}{H-h}$
            and then antidifferentiate $V'(H)$ to find $V(H)$. Since
            you don't know $V(H)-V(h)$ (yet), first find upper and lower
            bounds on it when $h<H$. These bounds can be the volumes of
            two cylinders, one with radius $H$ (and what height?)
            and the other with radius $h$.
