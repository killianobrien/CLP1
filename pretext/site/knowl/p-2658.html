<ul class="disc">
<li>Looking at the sketch, we see that the two curves cannot possibly intersect at any point having \(|x|&gt;1\) — if \(|x|&gt;1\text{,}\) then \(|x^3|&gt;1\) but \(|-\sin (x^5)|\le 1\) and we cannot possibly have \(x^3=-\sin(x^5)\text{.}\) That is, all roots of \(f(x)\) are in the interval \([-1,1]\text{.}\)</li>
<li>From the sketch, we would probably guess that \(y=x^3\) and \(y=-\sin(x^5)\) cross only at \(x=0\text{.}\) We can use Rolle's Theorem to verify that that is indeed the case.</li>
<li>If there is a root \(a \neq 0\text{,}\) then by Rolle's Theorem (since \(f(x)\) is continuous and differentiable for all real numbers \(x\)) \(f'(c)=0\) for some \(c\) strictly between \(0\) and \(a\text{.}\) In particular, since we already know any roots \(a\) will be between \(-1\) and \(1\text{,}\) if \(f(x)\) has two roots then \(f'(c)=0\) for some \(c \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)\text{.}\)</li>
<li>The derivative of \(f\) is<div class="displaymath">
\begin{equation*}
f'(x)=3x^2+5x^4\cos\big(x^5\big)=x^2\left(3+5x^2\cos\big(x^5\big)\right)
\end{equation*}
</div>So, if \(f'(x)=0\text{,}\) then \(x=0\) or \(\left(3+5x^2\cos\left(x^5\right)\right)=0\text{.}\) If \(x \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)\text{,}\) then<div class="displaymath">
\begin{align*}
|x|\lt 1 \amp\implies |x^5|\lt 1\lt \tfrac{\pi}{2}
\implies \cos\big(x^5\big)&gt;0 \\
\amp\implies 3+5x^2\cos\big(x^5\big) &gt; 3 \\
\amp\implies f'(x) \neq 0
\end{align*}
</div>That is, there is no \(c \in (-1,0) \cup (0,1)\) with \(f'(c)=0\text{.}\) Therefore, following our last  bullet point, \(f(x)\) has only one root.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note here that \(f'(x)\) has many zeroes — infinitely many, in fact. However, \(x=0\) is the only root of \(f'(x)\) in the interval \((-1,1)\text{.}\)</p>
