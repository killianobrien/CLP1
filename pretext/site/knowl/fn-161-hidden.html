<body><span class="footnote">A very common error of logic that people make is “Affirming the consequent”. When the statement “if P then Q” is true, observing Q does <em class="emphasis">not</em> imply P. (“Affirming the consequent” eliminates “not” from the previous sentence.) For example, “If he is Shakespeare then he is dead.” and “That man is dead.” does not imply “He must be Shakespeare.”. Or you may have also seen someone use this reasoning: “If a person is a genius before their time then they are misunderstood.” “I am misunderstood.” “So I must be a genius before my time.”.</span></body>
